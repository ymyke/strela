# Questions / TODOs

- Deployment:
  - Auf Pythonanywhere
  - Ueberwachungsscript nötig?
  - Auf X9 alle betr Prozesse löschen -- auch das prod Verzeichnis in code/

# later

- Make this a separate package "strela" or incorporate into "tessa"?
- If I end up renaming the package or integrating into tessa: Find all occurences of
  "strela" and adapt accordingly.
- Improve what/how symbols are exposed by this package and simplify some of the import
  statements in the modules.
- Switch to production tessa library once the add-symbols branch is released.
- Improve doc, add pdoc
