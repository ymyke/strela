# Questions / TODOs

- Improve doc, add pdoc
- Check all imports and maybe "nicify".
- Clean up branches.

- Deployment:
  - Auf Pythonanywhere
  - Ueberwachungsscript nötig?
  - Auf X9 alle betr Prozesse löschen -- auch das prod Verzeichnis in code/
  - Change the gmail app pwd

# later

- If I end up renaming the package or integrating into tessa: Find all occurences of
  "strela" and adapt accordingly.
- Where would mysymbols.yaml later "live"? Put it in a gist?
- Switch to production tessa library once the add-symbols branch is released.
